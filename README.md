# Issues

## Unable to use local json file in any way.

This is a relatively new update that all modern browsers have. If we try to fetch or import a local json file, it will not work because the browser will block it.

For this exercises we are not allowed to use any third party software, this means bundlers, frameworks, libraries or even nodejs are not allowed.

In order to really make this solution as asked by the employer, we'd either have to use some third party solution, or `--disable-web-security` which is a definite red flag.

All of this considered, I have decided to copy the contents of `data.json` into `data.js`, assign them to a variable and use the variable for all operations in `main.js`.

Here are some links for reference:

It would be awesome if you could share the solution with me.

## Building the card elements

While building the card elements I am using the `createElement` functionality, and setting `innerHTML` through a string in backticks. In my opinion this should not be done in practice because it's leaving us vulnerable to `XSS` attacks. To avoid this vulnerability I am omitting the variable parts from the strings that I pass into `innerHTML`, I am instead adding the variable parts using `innerText`, all in accordance to the data you've provided, of course. 

I am doing this because we're building what seems like a social media where the data may theoretically contain `XSS` attempts such as `...<script>...` in some strings, `innerText`provides some layer of protection from this, but I don't know if it's a long term fix.

Here's a cool link I found in regards to `innerText`: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52707031/does-innertext-prevent-xss

So, there is at least one case where `innerText` will not protect us from `XSS`, luckily in our case according to this link we're fine.
